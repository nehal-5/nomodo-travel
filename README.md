# Nomodo - Your AI-Powered Travel Companion ‚úàÔ∏è

Nomodo is a full-stack MERN application designed to be the ultimate companion for discovering, sharing, and planning your next adventure. It solves the common problem of "where should I go next?" by combining user-generated travel suggestions with the creative power of AI.

This project was built to demonstrate a modern, feature-rich web application using the MERN stack, complete with secure authentication, real-time data handling, and integration with third-party AI services.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Secure Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in securely using a system powered by JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Passwords are encrypted using bcryptjs.
* **Browse & Share Suggestions:** Logged-in users can browse a feed of travel ideas shared by others and create their own suggestions with titles, descriptions, locations, and images.
* **Powerful Search:** A dynamic search bar allows users to instantly filter suggestions by keywords, searching against both titles and locations.
* **AI Travel Assistant:** A dedicated page where users can get instant, unique travel ideas by providing a simple prompt (e.g., "suggest a quiet beach") to a generative AI.
* **AI Trip Planner:** A guided, multi-step form that asks users about their travel style, preferred month, and location type to generate a complete, day-by-day itinerary for a 2-day trip.
* **Protected Routes:** Backend routes are protected to ensure that only authenticated users can create content or access private features.
